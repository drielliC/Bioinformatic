sudo dnf install screen
apt install screen

screen -S NAME_OF_COMMAND
screen -ls 

Open a new screen 
[Ctrl]+[a]+[c] 

Now let's ping our server with the command: 
ping 192.168.1.208 (insert the IP address of your server). 
With that ping running, we can switch back to the previous screen with the key combination
[Ctrl]+[a]+[p] (which switches to the previous screen). You should now be back to your sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog screen. 
Hit the [Ctrl]+[a]+[n] (which switches to the next screen), and you're back to the ping command.

If you need to step away from the terminal, 
but want the command to continue running, 
you can manually detach the screen to reconnect with it later with the key combination 
[Ctrl]+[a]+[d]. This will return you to the standard prompt.


**the only screens you can reconnect to are those listed as Disconnected. 
This will happen if screen detects a network disconnection. If you become disconnected, and the screens haven't detached, 
you can detach and reconnect with them manually with the command:
screen -rd 2216.pts-0.ubuntu16
