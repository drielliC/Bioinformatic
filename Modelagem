 Then, we used the programs FunDi and GroupSim to validate the hypothesis that the conserved domains were associated with divergence (change) in function among GAs,
 and performed the GroupSim to identify the specificity determining positions (SDPs).
 
 GroupSim
 
 Sites identified as being functionally divergent or positively selective by all or two of these three programs were highlighted in the 3D protein structure of GA oxidases, 
 which could be tested with direct experimental techniques in the future.
 
 In order to reduce computation time and the potential impact of synonymous site saturation due to sequence divergence [77],
 the positive selection test was conducted on the site and branch-site models with 46 less divergent GAox homologs from six grass species of monocots.
