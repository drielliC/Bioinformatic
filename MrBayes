"lset" sets amino acid substitution model to be JTT (Jones, 1992). 
"mcmcp" sets parameters for Markov Chain Monte Carlo: 
we set to sample every 100 generation, to print results to a screen every 100th generation, save outfile named testseq1. 
"mcmc" actually runs the chain, and we set it to run for 20000 generations. 
After the run is finished, "sump" command will plot the logL vs. generation number, that allows to detect the burnin.

"sumt filename=testseq1c.t burnin=20", 
where you need to substitute burnin value with the number you obtained in the previous step of the exercise 
(Note: that burnin values is the # of generations divided by 50, since we sample every 50th generation). 
This command creates a consensus tree, and shows posterior probabilities of the clades.
