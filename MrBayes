"lset" sets amino acid substitution model to be JTT (Jones, 1992). 
"mcmcp" sets parameters for Markov Chain Monte Carlo: 
we set to sample every 100 generation, to print results to a screen every 100th generation, save outfile named testseq1. 
"mcmc" actually runs the chain, and we set it to run for 20000 generations. 
After the run is finished, "sump" command will plot the logL vs. generation number, that allows to detect the burnin.

"sumt filename=testseq1c.t burnin=20", 
where you need to substitute burnin value with the number you obtained in the previous step of the exercise 
(Note: that burnin values is the # of generations divided by 50, since we sample every 50th generation). 
This command creates a consensus tree, and shows posterior probabilities of the clades.

#############################################
The chain was run for 2.5 million generations starting from random trees, with trees sampled every 500 generations.
The first 1250 trees were discarded as "burn-in" to estimate the consensus topologies and the posterior distribution of trees was used to calculate posterior probabilities for clades. 

Phylogenetic Reconstruction. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed on MRBAYES 2.01 (29). All searches were started from a random tree, 
on four different Markov chains for 2,500,000 generations and saving every 100th tree. At convergence (10,000 generations),
the first 15,000 trees were discarded and a consensus was built. 
Posterior Bayesian probabilities were used to evaluate branch support. 
According to the recommendations of Foster (www.bioinf.orgmolsysdatalike.pdf), we used the GTR model with a substitution rate that varies in an intracodon position-specific
manner (GTR  SS).
