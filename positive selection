In case of Branch-site model one has to make ctr file like this:

For H0: model=2, NSsite=2, fix_omege=1, omega=1.

For H1: model=2, NSsite=2, fix_omege=0, omega=1.

For each model, we get the log likelihood value (lnL1 for the alternative and lnL0 for the null models), from which we compute the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT).

The 2×(lnL1-lnL0) follows a χ² curve with degree of freedom of 1, so we can get a p-value for this LRT.
eg. ΔLRT = 2×(lnL1 - lnL0) = 2×(-4707.210163 - (-4710.222252)) = 6.024178

The degree of freedom is 1 (np1 - np0 = 46 - 45).

I would do LRT, BC and FDR at 5% and 1% level of significance, and consider the sites >95% BEB confidence with FDR 1% level of significance.

Statistical tests of adaptive evolution among sites and lineages (branch-site models)

 ndata = 1 * number of gene alignments to be analysed

 fix_omega = 1 * 1: omega or omega_1 fixed, 0: estimate
 omega = 1 * initial or fixed omega for codons
 cleandata = 0 * remove sites with ambiguity data (1:yes, 0:no)?
 
We allow ω to vary among sites, but we have a fixed class of sites where ω = 1 for the background
and foreground branches. No sites with ω > 1 are allowed. Once the analysis has completed, look at the log-likelihood value in the mlc-M2-BS-H0 file:
lnL(ntime: 9 np: 13): -1129.989551 +0.000000

Now open codeml-M2-BS.ctl and edit the following options:
outfile = mlc-M2-BS-H1 * main result file name
fix_omega = 0 * 1: omega or omega_1 fixed, 0: estimate

Now run codeml again. We now allow ω > 1 for some sites in the foreground branch,
but ω = 1 for the same sites in the background branch. The output will be written to the mlc-MS-BS-H1 file. 
Look for the log-likelihood value:
lnL(ntime: 9 np: 14): -1129.989562 +0.000000

The likelihood ratio statistic is 2×(-1130 + 1130) = 0. There is no improvement in the
likelihood when we allow ω > 1 in the foreground branch. In the branch-site test of positive selection, the LRT test statistic does not follow a χ2 distribution since some of
the required regularity conditions are not met (Yang and dos Reis 2011). However, using a χ2 with one degree of freedom makes the test conservative.

Selective pressure was tested based on the phylogeny of genes by comparing the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratios (ω = d N /d S ) with ω = 1, < 1, and > 1, 
which indicate neutral evolution, purifying selection, and positive selection, respectively.
We selected F3X4 as codon frequency model, as it accounts for the most important feature of the mutation process, the unequal base frequencies, 
and the correction for transition/transversion bias is obtained by ML estimation of the kappa parameter.
Considering the fact that positive selection often operates episodically on a few amino acid sites in a small number of lineages of a phylogenetic tree, 
the modified branch-site model A was run for each gene in each lineage across the phylogenetic tree of the monocots. 
The LRT (likelihood ratio test) is a general method for testing assumptions (model parameters) through comparison of two competing hypotheses. 
We used branch-site model A to construct branch-site test 2, which is also called the branch-site test of positive selection. 
The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows: 
Null hypothesis (branch site model A, with ω2 = 1 fixed): model = 2; NSsites = 2; fix_omega = 1; omega = 1. 
Alternative hypothesis (branch site model A, with ω2 estimated): model = 2; NSsites = 2; fix_omega = 0; omega = 1.5 (or any value > 1). 
Unlike branch-site model, site-specific models allowing ω to vary among sites were used to determine whether particular amino-acid residues within gen families have been subject to positive selection. 
We use an LRT comparing M0 (one-ratio) with M3 (discrete) to test for variable selective pressure among sites, and two LRTs to test for sites evolving by positive selection, comparing: 
M1a (Nearly Neutral) against M2a (Positive Selection), and M7 (beta) against M8 (beta & ω). The PP (posterior probability) for the sites under positive selection was calculated 
by the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method.
