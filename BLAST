outfmt	| string alignment view options:
0 = pairwise,
1 = query-anchored showing identities,
2 = query-anchored no identities,
3 = flat query-anchored, show identities,
4 = flat query-anchored, no identities,
5 = XML Blast output,
6 = tabular,
7 = tabular with comment lines,
8 = Text ASN.1,
9 = Binary ASN.1
10 = Comma-separated values
11 = BLAST archive format (ASN.1)
12 = Seqalign (JSON),
13 = Multiple-file BLAST JSON,
14 = Multiple-file BLAST XML2,
15 = Single-file BLAST JSON,
16 = Single-file BLAST XML2,
17 = Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM),
18 = Organism Report
Options 6, 7, and 10 can be additionally configured to produce a custom format specified by space delimited format specifiers.
The supported format specifiers are:
qseqid means Query Seq-id
qgi means Query GI
qacc means Query accesion
sseqid means Subject Seq-id
sallseqid means All subject Seq-id(s), separated by a ';'
sgi means Subject GI
sallgi means All subject GIs
sacc means Subject accession
sallacc means All subject accessions
qstart means Start of alignment in query
qend means End of alignment in query
sstart means Start of alignment in subject
send means End of alignment in subject
qseq means Aligned part of query sequence
sseq means Aligned part of subject sequence
evalue means Expect value
bitscore means Bit score
score means Raw score
length means Alignment length
pident means Percentage of identical matches
nident means Number of identical matches
mismatch means Number of mismatches
positive means Number of positive-scoring matches
gapopen means Number of gap openings
gaps means Total number of gap
ppos means Percentage of positive-scoring matches
frames means Query and subject frames separated by a '/'
qframe means Query frame
sframe means Subject frame
btop means Blast traceback operations (BTOP)
staxids means unique Subject Taxonomy ID(s), separated by a ';'(in numerical order)
sscinames means unique Subject Scientific Name(s), separated by a ';'
scomnames means unique Subject Common Name(s), separated by a ';'
sblastnames means unique Subject Blast Name(s), separated by a ';' (in alphabetical order)
sskingdoms means unique Subject Super Kingdom(s), separated by a ';' (in alphabetical order)
stitle means Subject Title
salltitles means All Subject Title(s), separated by a '<>'
sstrand means Subject Strand
qcovs means Query Coverage Per Subject (for all HSPs)
qcovhsp means Query Coverage Per HSP
qcovus is a measure of Query Coverage that counts a position in a subject sequence for this measure only once. The second time the position is aligned to the query is not counted towards this measure.
When not provided, the default value is:
'qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore', which is equivalent to the keyword 'std'

-best_hit_overhang | Best-Hits filtering algorithm 
Aceptable range
-H 0.1 to 0.25
Overhang  - consider the size of alignment
Score Edge - consider the size of query

- parametros que podem ser adicionados no blast - como se fosse o best hit:

-best_hit_score_edge 0.05 -best_hit_overhang 0.25

We consider 0.1 to 0.25 to be an acceptable range for the -best_hit_overhang parameter and 0.05 to 0.25 to be an acceptable range for the -best_hit_score_edge parameter. Increasing the value of the overhang parameter eliminates a higher number of matches, but increases the running time; increasing the score_edge parameter removes smaller number of hits.
